act of publishing (digital) in the postdigital age?
What happens when we approach the book as an apparatus and what does that mean for the book as we know it? What does is mean for the notion of the author and the reader when we perform the book differently?
creative exploration of the possibilities that digital technology 

Most publishers offer some kind of electronic publication in addition to their range of print books, but this mostly concerns a one-on-one digitised version of the paper book. Such a conventional approach to digital products cannot be expected to lead to a sustainable market share for e-books or other digital outputs in the book sector. 

Digital outputs should be incorporated from the start of the publishing workflow; working towards multiple outputs from a single source file is the first step towards such a balanced hybrid publishing practice (see Image 2).

This need for a hybrid publishing workflow acts as the basis of the innovative aspects of EXPUBLIQUA. A truly hybrid publishing workflow, where digital publications are fully integrated into the publications range, calls for a thorough adaptation of strategies and work processes, based on different skill sets that have to be combined within traditional roles in the publishing process (DPT Collective 2014). An editor will have to get familiar with techniques of design, a designer has to gain skills in digital development, and so on. Hybrid publishing in this sense has been a key focal point in two large research projects conducted by the INC, in collaboration with some of the partnering consortium members.
