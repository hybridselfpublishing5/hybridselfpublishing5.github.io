<h2>Hybrid publishing and what are the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid publishing </h2>

* Yuan Mei 

There are 3 major trends in publishing right now: 1. Diversity will continue to be a driving economic force in publishing. The bottom line now is this: if publishers — and authors — do not embrace diversity, they will lose economically. 2. The competition for readers has reached new dimensions and mediums. Readers are accessing books in an ever-widening array of mediums. 3. Alternative media will drive tomorrow's best sellers. One adjustment to attract attention that authors might want to make? Turn their focus to alternative media.

In this context, hybrid publishing has become popular among publishers, writers, editors and designers, who are currently transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing, as its name suggests, combines the characteristics of different publishing models, creating a new and exciting way forward. This article will discuss in detail the different forms of hybrid publishing and its impact, positive or negative, on society and culture.

Most people agree that hybrid publishers combine aspects of traditional publishing and self-publishing, with business models ranging from assisted self-publishing to curated presses with traditional distribution. Other terms for hybrid models include co-publishing, partnership publishing, entrepreneurial publishing, boutique publishing, and custom publishing.

"Hybrid publishing is an emerging area that occupies the middle ground between traditional and self-publishing and therefore includes many different publishing models — basically anything that is not self-publishing or traditional publishing. “Hybrid publishing” is not a term all publishers or authors in this space use; other terms that describe this type of publishing include “author-assisted publishing”, “independent publishing”, “partnership publishing”, “co-publishing”, and “entrepreneurial publishing.”. But right now, because it’s a catchall, “hybrid publishing” is the umbrella term.” Brian A. Klems wrote in his Article “What is Hybrid Publishing”. 

A hybrid published author, M. Lachi said: “Hybrid publishing is an emerging third option for authors uninterested or unable to either self-publish or trade publish. This method of publishing — also known as partnership publishing or co-publishing — claims to foster the best of both the vanity and traditional, publishing paths. Infact, hybrid publishing generally encompasses everything in between, and thus means something slightly different to each publisher.”

Hybrid publishers take a little bit from the submission publishing model and a little bit from the self-publishing model. Hybrid publishers form a close business relationship with the writers whose work they produce. Hybrid publishers exercise editorial discretion, they conduct market research, and they derive their profit from book sales and rely on book sales to generate revenue. Hybrid publishing is a commercial venture.
Hybrid publishers work “up front” with their clients and offer publishing services to the businesses and writers whose works they choose to produce. 
Hybrid publishing requires new work methods and workflows that allow to turn lecture documentation into a multi-format publication. It’s transforming manuscripts, with the help of multiformat style libraries and single source content management, into multiple publishable outputs, like websites, eBooks, paper books, audio books etc.

It has the following characteristics:
-	various outcomes from single source file, 
-	constant connection between source-content and outcome,
-	avoiding repeating tasks by real-time collaborative editing.

<h3>The advantages of hybrid publishing: </h3>
1.Low-budget
The traditional publishing process, from author writing, to text editing, editorial design, printing, publishing and marketing, requires professionals to operate and therefore calls for a huge budget. In contrast, hybrid publishing is to some extent like entrepreneurial or assisted self-publishing: the writer may manage the publishing process and he will do most of the works, from writing to marketing and distributing his work in a public or semi-public forum, directly to the readers.

2.Interactive multimedia
Multimedia is still difficult to realize in traditional books. Yet there are new opportunities for entirely new publication formats (such as books with customized content and micro-books) in hybrid publishing. Possibilities in this direction lie in offering high-quality 'zoomable' images and adding additional material such as video (documentary, animation, etc.), audio (interviews, lectures, etc.) or even 'interactive' media.
On the other hand, Touch-Screen technology, image and sound processing devices allow webs and apps to provide more different interactions, providing multiple images and sound information extraction possibilities, making outputs more diverse and therefore making reading more efficient and fun.

3.Design-oriented
In hybrid publishing visuals play a central role, through codes let content and layout add flexibility, thus images as well as texts play a central role; even text is secondary (text refers to visuals); and descriptive texts could be various lengths; and there are be less fixed page layout format; Design-Oriented Publishing is more legible and more centered on the user's reading experience and user's cognitive habits.

4.Direct Communication
By working with a hybrid publisher, writers have the opportunity to work with a publisher, an editorial team, and a publicity team hand-in-hand. This means that all parties involved receive direct, prompt feedback concerning each other’s work. Also, writes can communicate with readers online. They will even interact with readers, receive readers’ comments immediately, learn more about readers and know the readers ‘taste, and understand market trends.

5.Creative Flexibility
Writers in traditional publishing need to worry about following literary trends or trying to change their artistic vision in order to impress a publisher! However, hybrid publishers gain creative freedom by publishing independently, with their artistic vision remaining intact.

6.Hybrid-print 
Hybrid-Print allows for a myriad of possibilities for publishing content. It could be websites, eBooks, paper books, audio books etc. It could also be content in recurring or periodical publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.). In addition, the publisher can change the content of the online-publication at any time, and the reader can store the published content in any form or print the content at any time.

On the one hand, hybrid publishing provides great freedom, flexibility and diversity. On the other hand, the advantages of hybrid publishing also cause some problems, and these problems gradually attract social attention. 

The disadvantages of hybrid publishing:

1.Abuse 
Traditional publishers act like gatekeepers. Publishing agents invest their time and money in a book when they publish it. To make sure that they recoup their investment, concentrating their efforts on a relatively small number of books with high quality. But hybrid publishing, theoretically allows everyone to have the freedom and opportunity to publish. Everyone can write their own opinions and feelings on a public platform, and actively or passively spread it to others, either people they know or strangers. This way, publishing loses quality control. We gradually lose the gatekeepers, in other words, the goalkeeper can't defend the huge information flow. Particularly, some individuals or businesses can spread fake news and confuse people to achieve their political or economic goals. This can lead to content run wild and the quality of publishings is out of control. People may not find valuable content in the flood of information or more seriously, be misleaded by fake news and gossip. 

2.Risks for authors 
Traditional publishing: Slim chance of acceptance, and if the publishers do accept, they run the show.

Self-publishing: Cheap, but the writer does not own all of the rights. He has to figure out all his marketing and he may not have access to distributors or booksellers.

Hybrid publishing: The author may pay big money and might not get their investment back. He has to do the work and the learning on his own, especially as an inexperienced author. The lack of professional editing and distribution means that the author may spend a lot of time and money, but the assumed masterpiece turns out to be just a small and inconspicuous book in an enormously large number of online books.


3.Distribution and marketing
Standalone hybrid publishers are a relatively recent phenomenon, some hybrid publishing platforms have appeared on the Internet. But their reputations and resources aren’t as strong. They are growing, no doubt about it. However, they lack professional content control and marketing skills, often resulting in unexpected losses. Even if they find high-quality content or talented authors, they will likely not be able to make their works shine in the market.


<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

In general, hybrid publishing is a new possibility of publishing. It is worth trying and exploring. It not only provides more possibilities for authors and readers, but also affords more stage for content, especially in interactive from. On the other hand, hybrid publishing still lacks answers to some essential questions: How can hybrid publishing platforms bring together talented authors and content producers to present their creations through better production processes and demonstrate them to the market and readers in an effective way? How can the publishing service platform take over the advantages of the traditional publishing industry while abandoning its disadvantages? If hybrid publishing can find innovation opportunities, embrace the diversity of multi culture and diversity of publishing, find a multi-dimension of content and cross-media and a multimedia content platform to represent these, it will be the future of publishing in digital age.

For hybrid publisher, the California-based Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA) has released a round of nine criteria for reputable operation of a “hybrid publisher.”:

1.Define a mission and vision for its publishing program. In a traditional publishing company, the published work often reflects the interests and values of its publisher … Good hybrid publishers are no different.
2.Vet submissions. …  Good hybrid publishers don’t publish everything that comes over the transom and often decline to publish.
3.Publish under its own imprint(s) and ISBNs. A hybrid publisher is a true publishing house, with either a publisher or a publishing team developing and
distributing books.
4.Publish to industry standards. A hybrid publisher accepts full responsibility for the quality of the titles it publishes. Books released by a hybrid publisher should be on par with traditionally published books.
5.Ensure editorial, design, and production quality. A hybrid publisher is responsible for producing books edited, designed, and produced to a professional degree. This includes assigning editors for developmental editing, copyediting, and proofreading, as needed, together with following traditional standards for a professionally designed book.
6.Pursue and manage a range of publishing rights. A hybrid publisher normally publishes in both print and digital formats, as appropriate, and perhaps pursues other rights, in order to reach the widest possible readership. As with a traditional publisher, authors may negotiate to keep their subsidiary rights, such as foreign language, audio, and other derivative rights.
7.Provide distribution services. A hybrid publisher has a strategic approach to distribution beyond simply making books available for purchase via online retailers. … This may mean traditional distribution, wherein a team of sales reps actively markets and sells books to retailers, or it may mean publisher outreach to a network of specialty retailers, clubs, or other niche-interest organizations. At minimum, a hybrid publisher develops, with the author, a marketing and sales strategy for each book it publishes, inclusive of appropriate sales channels for that book, and provides ongoing assistance to the author seeking to execute this strategy in order to get his or her book in front of its target audience. This is in addition to listing books with industry-recognized wholesalers.
8.Demonstrate respectable sales. A hybrid publisher should have a record of producing several books that sell in respectable quantities for the book’s niche.
9.Pay authors a higher-than-standard royalty. A hybrid publisher pays its authors more than the industry-standard royalty range on print and digital books, in exchange for the author’s personal investment. Although royalties are generally negotiable, the author’s share must be laid out transparently and must be commensurate with the author’s investment. In most cases, the author’s royalty should be greater than 50 percent of net on both print and digital books.

These can formally guide the publisher's work in form and provide certain principles, but for the publisher to explore the diversity of content and form, to find the Steve Jobs so-called intersection of technology and art. to present it in the best medien, and these are the publisher's greatest freedom and pursuit in hybrid publishing.
