<h2>Hybrid publishing and what are the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid publishing </h2>

* Yuan Mei 

There are 3 major trends in publishing right now: 1. Diversity will continue to be a driving economic force in publishing. The bottom line now is this: if publishers — and authors — do not embrace diversity, they will lose economically. 2. The competition for readers has reached new dimensions and mediums. Readers are accessing books in an ever-widening array of mediums. 3. Alternative media will drive tomorrow's best sellers. One adjustment to attract attention that authors might want to make? Turn their focus to alternative media.

In this context, hybrid publishing has become popular among publishers, writers, editors and designers, who are currently transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing, as its name suggests, combines the characteristics of different publishing models, creating a new and exciting way forward. This article will discuss in detail the different forms of hybrid publishing and its impact, positive or negative, on society and culture.

Most people agree that hybrid publishers combine aspects of traditional publishing and self-publishing, with business models ranging from assisted self-publishing to curated presses with traditional distribution. Other terms for hybrid models include co-publishing, partnership publishing, entrepreneurial publishing, boutique publishing, and custom publishing.

"Hybrid publishing is an emerging area that occupies the middle ground between traditional and self-publishing and therefore includes many different publishing models — basically anything that is not self-publishing or traditional publishing. “Hybrid publishing” is not a term all publishers or authors in this space use; other terms that describe this type of publishing include “author-assisted publishing”, “independent publishing”, “partnership publishing”, “co-publishing”, and “entrepreneurial publishing.”. But right now, because it’s a catchall, “hybrid publishing” is the umbrella term.” Brian A. Klems wrote in his Article “What is Hybrid Publishing”. 

A hybrid published author, M. Lachi said: “Hybrid publishing is an emerging third option for authors uninterested or unable to either self-publish or trade publish. This method of publishing — also known as partnership publishing or co-publishing — claims to foster the best of both the vanity and traditional, publishing paths. Infact, hybrid publishing generally encompasses everything in between, and thus means something slightly different to each publisher.”

Hybrid publishers take a little bit from the submission publishing model and a little bit from the self-publishing model. Hybrid publishers form a close business relationship with the writers whose work they produce. Hybrid publishers exercise editorial discretion, they conduct market research, and they derive their profit from book sales and rely on book sales to generate revenue. Hybrid publishing is a commercial venture.
Hybrid publishers work “up front” with their clients and offer publishing services to the businesses and writers whose works they choose to produce. 
Hybrid publishing requires new work methods and workflows that allow to turn lecture documentation into a multi-format publication. It’s transforming manuscripts, with the help of multiformat style libraries and single source content management, into multiple publishable outputs, like websites, eBooks, paper books, audio books etc.

It has the following characteristics:
-	various outcomes from single source file, 
-	constant connection between source-content and outcome,
-	avoiding repeating tasks by real-time collaborative editing.

<h4>The advantages of hybrid publishing: </h4>
1.	Low-budget
The traditional publishing process, from author writing, to text editing, editorial design, printing, publishing and marketing, requires professionals to operate and therefore calls for a huge budget. In contrast, hybrid publishing is to some extent like entrepreneurial or assisted self-publishing: the writer may manage the publishing process and he will do most of the works, from writing to marketing and distributing his work in a public or semi-public forum, directly to the readers.

2.	Interactive multimedia
Multimedia is still difficult to realize in traditional books. Yet there are new opportunities for entirely new publication formats (such as books with customized content and micro-books) in hybrid publishing. Possibilities in this direction lie in offering high-quality 'zoomable' images and adding additional material such as video (documentary, animation, etc.), audio (interviews, lectures, etc.) or even 'interactive' media.
On the other hand, Touch-Screen technology, image and sound processing devices allow webs and apps to provide more different interactions, providing multiple images and sound information extraction possibilities, making outputs more diverse and therefore making reading more efficient and fun.

3.	Design-oriented
In hybrid publishing visuals play a central role, through codes let content and layout add flexibility, thus images as well as texts play a central role; even text is secondary (text refers to visuals); and descriptive texts could be various lengths; and there are be less fixed page layout format; Design-Oriented Publishing is more legible and more centered on the user's reading experience and user's cognitive habits.

4.	Direct Communication
By working with a hybrid publisher, writers have the opportunity to work with a publisher, an editorial team, and a publicity team hand-in-hand. This means that all parties involved receive direct, prompt feedback concerning each other’s work. Also, writes can communicate with readers online. They will even interact with readers, receive readers’ comments immediately, learn more about readers and know the readers ‘taste, and understand market trends.

5.	Creative Flexibility
Writers in traditional publishing need to worry about following literary trends or trying to change their artistic vision in order to impress a publisher! However, hybrid publishers gain creative freedom by publishing independently, with their artistic vision remaining intact.

6.	Hybrid-print 
Hybrid-Print allows for a myriad of possibilities for publishing content. It could be websites, eBooks, paper books, audio books etc. It could also be content in recurring or periodical publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.). In addition, the publisher can change the content of the online-publication at any time, and the reader can store the published content in any form or print the content at any time.

On the one hand, hybrid publishing provides great freedom, flexibility and diversity. On the other hand, the advantages of hybrid publishing also cause some problems, and these problems gradually attract social attention.
